// Game: Rock, Paper, Scissors

// Notes:
// This is essentially a "value comparison" game
// One player chooses a value
// The other player chooses a value
// The values are evaluated and compared based on game rules
// A winner and loser are declared
// Repeat until bored

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------

// Pseudocode: version 1 - essential game loop functions

// Human chooses "rock", "paper", or "scissors" via input
// Computer chooses "rock", "paper", or "scissors" via random selection
// The choices are compared
// A winner and loser are declared
// Repeat this cycle 5 times to complete the game loop

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------

// Pseudocode: version 2 - game loop plus interaction

// Print, "Do you want to start a game?"
// User inputs, "Yes" or "No"
// If yes, go to START GAME
// If no, exit 
// START GAME
// START ROUND
// User inputs choice of "rock", "paper", or "scissors"
// Computer randomly chooses
// Print the user and computer's choices
// If user wins, print "You win this round!"
// If computer wins, print "You lose this round."
// End round
// Repeat until 5 rounds have been played
// The winner of the whole game is who won the most rounds
// If user wins more than computer, print "You won the game!"
// If user wins less than computer, print "You lost the game."
// Print, "Do you want to play another game?"
// User inputs, "Yes" or "No"
// If yes, clear results and start round
// If no, exit game
