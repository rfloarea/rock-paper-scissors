## Project Log (or plog :P)

Sunday, January 7, 2024 @8:59pm

I am stupid proud of myself for getting this thing working. And it's not even fully built out yet!

I coded out the foundational game loop in one day. I've never *really* coded before. I've poked around here and there, but never found a project, planned it out, and worked through the solution until it worked.

It's so cool! What a confidence builder! This just makes me want to add functionality and make it interactive and just a joy to use.

Notes to my future self:
1. Learn to write pseudocode in your sleep. This is an absolute essential tool. It's not just planning. It's organizing your thinking into functional blocks. 
2. Learn to use the Devtools debugger in your sleep. Stepping through this little script was essential to actually understanding what was going on.
    Bonus: it helps you learn how JS moves through a script. With enough use you should begin to internalize the call stack. Which I'm sure is very important.
3. Learn more about scope. Pay attention to this concept when you get back to coding. I think this is going to trip you up a lot in the near future.

I did it! I figured out how to create a single loop of the game, but using functions this time! Dam that tied my brain up. But only because I didn't really understand how to implement the logic.

My understanding of functions was very bad yesterday, so I got all messed up and struggled for hours. Which was good to experience. It taught me that it's really helpful to ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU ARE DOING AND WHY. Huh, who knew.

Now all that's left (for right now) is to create a way to keep score over many rounds and count the rounds as they go.

Notes to future self:
1. Remember this feeling. Remember how bad it feels to not find a solution while it feels so close. Remember how good it feels to spend the time to understand, and then *see* a solution.
